## Create a Chart with multiple Dataset switching via state React + react-chartjs - DEMO Code

This tutorial goes over a basic overview of a method to create a chart in a class component in react using 
react-chartjs-2 and how to update the chart with different data using SetState within that chart based on 
onClick events within the component - in this example 3 months, 6 months and a year.

In a real life example you would probably get your data from props, or state but this should provide a 
good starting point for understanding how to do this.

Everything is standard create react app apart from BarChart.js
